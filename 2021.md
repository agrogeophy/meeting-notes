# Agrogeophysic Community Calls 2021

## About

Community calls are **open to everyone**! Links are posted in Slack at the time of the meeting.


## 2021-05-18

**Time:** 13:00 UTC (14:00 CET)

**Participants**

- Guillaume Blanchy
- Benjamin Mary

**Notes**
Discussion on how to built a pipeline for harmonization of the future contribution to feed the database **with soil and petrophysical data**
Idea: utiliser geometadata structure GUI
Digitalization (past contributions)
In the tab Home --> select 'petro ER=f(WC)' --> Create new tab
- 1st block: collect metadata (authors, ...)
   -> Import direct de metadata: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agrogeophy/catalog/master/db.csv'
   -> Presence of vegetation/bare soil
   -> Soil type (WRB, soil texture, horizon)
   -> Spatial/profondeur
- 2nd: upload data (csv file in a given format)
- 3: check quality/ units
- 4: store data (dataframe ?)
- 5: stack all contributions
- 6: visualisation
- 7: computation (fit,...)
- 8: visualisation

**Time:** 13:00 UTC (14:00 CET)

**Participants**

- Guillaume Blanchy
- Benjamin Mary

**Notes**
- JAMStack migration: online form:
Moving to a static website, we need to choose a way to accept new contribution. The current online form was sending data to a PHP page that was redirecting it as an automatic email to admins with attachements if provided. Three possiblities were discussed:
  (a) a google form that needs user to log in in their Google account to submit the form but that prevent bots;
  (b) a custom mailto that embed the answer as a .csv string in the content, it let's then user attach notebook or cover picture manually to the mail;
  (c) a template for merge request but this requires user to know how to use Github.
Option (b) has been chosen as the most convenient one (we don't require user to be able to use github or to have a Google account). GB will implement that. In addition, the use of information already provided in the database to fill drop-box field (e.g. suggesting methods) will be added.

- relational database or single .csv: for simplicity of maintenance, it has been chosen to use a single .csv file (with not all columns filled). It can easily be manually edited if changes are needed.

- bugs: sentence below the table is misplaced, no green circle on the map. GB will fixed that.

- merging notebook repository and general repository structure: we've settled on leaving the structure as this (separate repository for notebook and catalog).

- GB will clean the catalog repository to  build the JAMStack version. Links to the catalog and notebook documentation will be integrated into the main website.

- integration with 2i2c is, for now, delayed

- BM suggested to send an abstract to EGU 2021. Possible session is: [Hydrogeophysics: a tool for hydrology, ecology, agronomy and beyond](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/39484)

- Discussion about a possible call for funding to sustain and develop the CAGS tools, in particular the data management part was postopone to next meeting due to lack of participants.

- Guillaume Blanchy
- Benjamin Mary

**Notes**
- BM presents the geophysical metadata manager
- Discussion on the issue on putting it on voila and interact with local files
- Interpolability of CAGS metadata standart. GB share a template file from the Bonares database.
- BM mentionned the possibility for EU funding encouraging FAIR practicies (https://cordis.europa.eu/programme/id/H2020_SwafS-04-2018/fr) and Call for funding to promote FAIR and open-science(Horizon Europe): https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/swafs-04-2018
